# AY-Code-Refractor

## Overview

Our task for the Code Refractor exercise was to make the html and stylesheet was given more legible and condensed. I proceeded to do the following complete the task.

## HTML

On the Html side of the assingment I replaced all of the <div> semantics to ones like <nav>, <sections>, <aside>, <main>, etc. that way the code would be more legible. I also had to the alt="" attribute to the images so that the images could be provided an alternate text if the image somehow was unable to be displayed.

## CSS

After reviewing some of the CSS stylesheet I noticed alot of repititon and so I made some modifications to the classes on the HTML so that I would be able to consolidate some of the same styles that were being used. I also re-arranged parts of the css to make sure it was more sequential based on how the webpage was displayed. This allowed the stylesheet to not be so extensive and became more easily legible.

## Completion

After consolidating the stylesheet and make the code easy to direct on the index.html the assignment was completed
