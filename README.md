# AY-Code-Refractor

## Overview

In this Code Refractor exercise I replaced all of the <div> semantics to be more legible. I also had to at the alt="" to the images so that the images could be legible for screen readers.

After reviewing some of the stylesheet I began to consolidate it all a bit after noticing alot of repetition. In doing so I had to refer back to the index sheet to change some of the class.
